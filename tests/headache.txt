Physician: Hello, Ms. Green. How can I help you today?

Patient: Hi, doctor. I’ve been getting headaches almost every day after school.

Physician: When did they start?

Patient: About two months ago.

Physician: Where do you usually feel the pain?

Patient: Mostly across my forehead and behind my eyes.

Physician: Do you spend a lot of time on screens?

Patient: Yes, I’m on my laptop most of the day for homework.

Physician: That could be contributing. Any nausea, dizziness, or vision problems?

Patient: No, just the headaches.

Physician: Your symptoms are consistent with tension-type headaches. Improving posture, taking screen breaks, and staying hydrated should help.

Patient: That sounds manageable.

Physician: If they become more severe or frequent, come back and we’ll reassess.
