Physician: Hello, Ms. Ahmed. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Hi, doctor. I’ve been getting stomach aches on and off.

Physician: When do they usually occur?

Patient: Mostly in the mornings, especially on school days.

Physician: Any vomiting, weight loss, or fever?

Patient: No, none of that.

Physician: Do you feel stressed or rushed in the mornings?

Patient: Yes, a bit.

Physician: That can sometimes cause stomach discomfort. Everything you’ve described sounds mild, but we’ll keep an eye on it.

Patient: Okay.

Physician: Try regular meals and giving yourself more time in the morning. Come back if the pain worsens or changes.
